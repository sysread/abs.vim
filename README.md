# abs.vim

Basic file detection and syntax highlighting for [abs-lang](https://www.abs-lang.org/)

## Installation

I am too lazy to type out full instructions for manual installation or anything
harder than Vundle.

Add to your .vimrc between `call vundle#begin()` and `call vundle#end()`:

    Plugin 'sysread/abs.vim'

Then install from within vim:

    :VundleInstall
